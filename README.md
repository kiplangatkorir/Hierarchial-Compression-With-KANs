# Hierarchical Compression of LLM Weights using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks

## Overview

This project implements a hierarchical compression scheme for Large Language Model (LLM) weights using Kolmogorov-Arnold networks. The goal is to significantly reduce model size while maintaining performance, potentially enabling the use of large models in resource-constrained environments.

## Background

Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, suggest that any multivariate continuous function can be represented as a superposition of univariate functions. This concept is applied here to create a hierarchical compression scheme for neural network weights.

## Key Features

1. Hierarchical compression using Kolmogorov-Arnold networks

2. Potential for significant reduction in model size

3. Preservation of important model features through hierarchical representation

4. Configurable compression levels and network architectures

## Requirements

Python 3.7+

PyTorch

NumPy

LLM like GPT2/ DistillBERT

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kolmogorov-arnold-llm-compression.git
cd kolmogorov-arnold-llm-compression
```
2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Implementation Details
The hierarchical compression scheme is implemented as follows:

1. The LLM weights are flattened into a 1D vector.
   
2. Multiple levels of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks are created, each compressing the output of the previous level.
   
3. Each network learns to represent its input as a composition of simpler functions.
   
4. The final compressed representation is a hierarchy of these simpler functions.

## Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use the compression scheme:

```python
from kolmogorov_arnold_compression import HierarchicalCompressor, decompress_weights

# Initialize your LLM
model = YourLLMModel()

# Create a compressor
compressor = HierarchicalCompressor(
    input_dim=model.num_parameters(),
    num_levels=3,
    hidden_dims=[512, 256, 128]
)

# Compress the model weights
compressed_weights = compressor.compress(model.state_dict())

# To use the compressed model:
decompressed_weights = decompress_weights(compressed_weights)
model.load_state_dict(decompressed_weights)
```
## Evaluation
To evaluate the effectiveness of the compression:

- Measure the size reduction achieved by the compression.
  
- Compare the performance of the original and compressed models on relevant tasks.
  
- Analyze the trade-off between model size and performance.

## Limitations and Future Work

The current implementation may be computationally intensive for very large models.

The optimal architecture for Kolmogorov-Arnold networks may vary depending on the specific LLM and task.

**Future work could explore:**

- Adaptive compression levels based on layer importance
  
- Integration with other compression techniques like pruning or quantization
  
- Theoretical analysis of the compression's impact on model expressivity
